This application was created as an example of using the `@justifi/angular-components` package in an Angular 16 application.

Here are some key files to look at for:
- [Including webcomponents.css](https://github.com/justifi-tech/example-angular-app/blob/main/src/index.html#L10)
- [Template syntax/props](https://github.com/justifi-tech/example-angular-app/blob/main/src/app/app.component.html#L3)
- [JustiFi CSS variables](https://github.com/justifi-tech/example-angular-app/blob/main/src/app/app.component.css#L12)


# Commands
- `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
- `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
- `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
- `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
- `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
